2. REPORT DETAILS
-----------------
PDRC-153#1 Warning
Gated clock check  
Net u_lcd_disp_char/u_rd_id/CLK is a gated clock net sourced by a combinational pin u_lcd_disp_char/u_rd_id/lcd_clk_OBUF_inst_i_1/O, cell u_lcd_disp_char/u_rd_id/lcd_clk_OBUF_inst_i_1. This is not good design practice and will likely impact performance. For SLICE registers, for example, use the CE pin to control the loading of data.
Related violations: <none>

PLHOLDVIO-2#1 Warning
Non-Optimal connections which could lead to hold violations  
A LUT u_lcd_disp_char/u_rd_id/lcd_clk_OBUF_inst_i_1 is driving clock pin of 23 cells. This could lead to large hold time violations. Involved cells are:
u_lcd_disp_char/u_lcd_display/pixel_data_reg[23], u_lcd_disp_char/u_lcd_driver/h_cnt_reg[0], u_lcd_disp_char/u_lcd_driver/h_cnt_reg[10], u_lcd_disp_char/u_lcd_driver/h_cnt_reg[1], u_lcd_disp_char/u_lcd_driver/h_cnt_reg[2], u_lcd_disp_char/u_lcd_driver/h_cnt_reg[3], u_lcd_disp_char/u_lcd_driver/h_cnt_reg[4], u_lcd_disp_char/u_lcd_driver/h_cnt_reg[5], u_lcd_disp_char/u_lcd_driver/h_cnt_reg[6], u_lcd_disp_char/u_lcd_driver/h_cnt_reg[7], u_lcd_disp_char/u_lcd_driver/h_cnt_reg[8], u_lcd_disp_char/u_lcd_driver/h_cnt_reg[9], u_lcd_disp_char/u_lcd_driver/v_cnt_reg[0], u_lcd_disp_char/u_lcd_driver/v_cnt_reg[10], u_lcd_disp_char/u_lcd_driver/v_cnt_reg[1] (the first 15 of 23 listed)
