Asynchronous driver check  
DSP u_cymometer/data_fx_t0__2 input pin u_cymometer/data_fx_t0__2/B[3] is connected to registers with an asynchronous reset. This is preventing the possibility of merging these registers in to the DSP Block since the DSP block registers only possess synchronous reset capability.

LUT on the clock tree  
The LUT u_lcd_rgb_char/u_rd_id/lcd_clk_OBUF_inst_i_1 has been found on the clock tree. Run opt_design to optimize the clock trees, then re-run report_methodology. If LUT(s) are still present in the clock trees, modify the RTL or the synthesis options accordingly to move the clock gating logic to dedicated clock enable resources.
